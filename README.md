# 🖼️ Image Classification Model

This repository contains an image classification model that classifies images into different categories using deep learning. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and can be used to make predictions on new images. 

### 🔹 Features:
- Supports multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
- Can classify images into predefined categories
- Uses a deep learning framework (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch)
- Can be fine-tuned or retrained on new datasets

### 🚀 Usage:
- Load the trained model
- Provide an image as input
- Get the predicted category

This model can be used for various applications like object recognition, automated tagging, and more.
